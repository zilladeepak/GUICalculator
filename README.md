# Calculator
 It is a basic GUI Calculator built using Python tkinter.
 
 
 ### Modifications to be made
 - [ ] Buttons are not spaced correctly (margin is not organized well)
 - [ ] To extend this and to built a scientific calculator.
 
 
 
 #### Problems In this
  - [ ] Present Numbers are deleting after clicking new number/operation but they are stored in memory i.e; not displaying total equation.<br>
(If any one out there please help me out to find a solution for this)
